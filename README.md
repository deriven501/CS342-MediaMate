CSCI 342: Web Scripting

About:
The name of our web application is called MediaMate. Inspired by similar websites such as
GoodReads, IMDB, and LetterBoxd, MediaMate serves to be a repository of information about
many different games, movies and books. This site also allows users to access and see
information about those games, movies and books, to create an account to add movies, games
and books to their library, and to see other usersâ€™ changes to their library through the feed.
